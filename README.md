# BrainStation-CapstoneProject

# My name Ali Sehpar Shikoh and this was my capstone project that was submitted for BrainStation's Data Science Diploma.

# The project aimed to determine the influence of various parameters in the determination of crop yield.

# The project follow the following sequence:

# 1) Clean the raw data, perform basic EDA and export the refined version to a CSV file.
# 2) Combine various refined datafiles into a single dataset, perform additiona EDA and export the combined version to a CSV file.
# 3) Preprocess the data, implement various models, evaluate and later interpret the fitted models.

# All the project related files are organized in four main folders as seen below:
