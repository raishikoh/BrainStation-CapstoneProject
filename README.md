# BrainStation-CapstoneProject

My name Ali Sehpar Shikoh and this was my capstone project that was submitted for BrainStation's Data Science Diploma.

The project aimed to determine the influence of various parameters in the determination of crop yield.

The project follow the following sequence:

1) Clean the raw data, perform basic EDA and export the refined version to a CSV file.
2) Combine various refined datafiles into a single dataset, perform additiona EDA and export the combined version to a CSV file.
3) Preprocess the data, implement various models, evaluate and later interpret the fitted models.
